Project Title: Now Playing
Team: Anthony Ngu, Ashley Jimenez, Trevis Thomas
Description: A website that shows you the most popular TV Shows and Movies and their rating, synopsis, cast, trailer link and a collection of review scores. Also, a search feature that lets you pull up any movie/TV show youï¿½d like to know more about.
APIs: OMDB (for movie/TV Show information); TrailerAddict (for movie/TV Show trailers).
Tasks: 
1. Create four hmtl files: Index, Movies, TV, and Dynamic.
a. Index will be our landing page with an intro and links to our favorites movies/shows.
i. All four will have a nav bar with a link to movies, tv and dynamic (search).
b. Movies will have two cards that display the most popular movies in theatres and the most popular movies that are now on DVD/streaming (this will be static and not dynamic for now, to keep the project manageable).
c. TV will have two cards listing the most popular TV shows on air as well as the most popular classic TV shows (also static and not dynamic).
d. Dynamic will have multiple cards for the poster, review scores, rating, year, cast, synopsis and a link to a movie trailer. Any time a search is run or a link is clicked on on another page, an API call is run with the term for the search/link and fills the dynamic page with the relevant info.


Group Do: Designing your MVP
Instructions
With your group, answer each of the following questions:

Who is your target audience? movie/tv people
What is the problem that the product will address? finding something to watch at home or at the movies
What is the primary goal of the product? consolodating information about movies/tv
Identify and prioritize essential user stories (limit this to 3 or fewer)? can search movies, can search tv shows, can do this by type search or by by category, most popular/by review/currently on/
Remember, your MVP should be the absolute minimum product that you need to pitch your idea to investors (or your classmates). Think bare essentials.

As an example, the essential features of an instagram-like application might look like:

As a user, I want to post pictures so that I can share my life.
As a user, I want to be able to search for other users so that I can find their list of images.
As a user, I want to be able to view other people's images so that I can keep up with what's happening in their lives.
Things like liking photos, sending photos to friends, making instagram stories, etc are cool, but they aren't essential. They should not be part of the MVP.
